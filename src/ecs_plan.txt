World needs to be able to ask Systems what components they care about
Then it needs to be able to get the entities with those components
Then call the Systems tick/update/execute with that list


Entity -> Player
  Component -> Position
  Component -> Velocity
  Component -> Inventory
  Component -> Graphics (sprite)
  Component -> Collision
  Component -> Controllable

Entity -> Item
  Component -> Position
  Component -> Graphics (sprite)
  Component -> Acquire-able

Entity -> Wall
  Component -> Graphics
  Component -> Position
  Component -> Collision
  (Using the wall entites to make our outer boundary)

Entity -> Enemy

Systems:                   Components it acts on:
  KeyboardInputSystem   ->  [Controllable, Velocity]
  MovementSystem        ->  [Velocity, Position] (Maybe Collision?)
    Hunter thinks we should have a separate system for collision, but we're gonna try adding it into movement
  GraphicsSystem        ->  [Graphics, Position]
